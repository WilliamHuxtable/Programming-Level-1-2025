All code and resources from Programming Level 1 in Grade 11

Most of the code is in Swift and the main framework that we used in the class is SwiftUI.

This also contains the app framework that I developed. You can find it in the **FitForge** folder.

My slide deck is located on Canva, which I pitched during the *Final Showcase* in June 2025.

## Context

I learned Swift this semester. I didn't know very much about it. Throughout the term I learned how to put together a really cool wireframe in Keynote. Then, I took a chance and learned how to translate the ideas from the Keynote to an actual app using Swift UI and Swift.

/*
Welcome to the Constants and Variables Lab!

In this lab, weâ€™ll explore how to use constants and variables in Swift.

- Constants (created with `let`) are values that donâ€™t change.
- Variables (created with `var`) are values that can change.

Letâ€™s dive in! ðŸš€
*/

// Exercise 1: Declaring a constant
// TODO: Declare a constant called `birthYear` and set it to your birth year.

let birthYear = 2008


// Exercise 2: Declaring a variable
// TODO: Declare a variable called `currentAge` and set it to your current age.

var currentAge = 17

// Exercise 3: Changing the value of a variable
// Imagine youâ€™re a year older. Update `currentAge` to reflect this new age.



// Exercise 4: Trying to change a constant
// Uncomment the line below to see what happens when you try to change a constant!

// Q: Why doesnâ€™t this work?
// Because it is constant and it cannot be changed

Mini Build: Life Tracker (5 min)

Letâ€™s build a small script that simulates tracking your age over the next few years.
1. Declare a constant for `myBirthYear`.
2. Declare a variable `currentYear` (set it to the current year).
3. Calculate your age by subtracting `myBirthYear` from `currentYear`.
4. Update `currentYear` to simulate each new year, and update your age.

Try adding print statements to track the changes.

let myBirthYear = 2008
var currentYear = 2025
var age = currentYear - myBirthYear

print("Year:\(currentYear), Age: \(age)")

currentYear+=10
age = currentYear - birthYear
print("Year: \(currentYear), Age: \(age)")

// Increment the year and age to simulate time passing
